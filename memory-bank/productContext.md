# MessageAI — Product Context

## Why This Exists
MessageAI was built as a comprehensive **International Communicator** - an AI-powered real-time messaging platform that evolved far beyond its original MVP scope. The focus expanded from basic messaging to a full-featured international communication app with advanced AI capabilities and complete language localization system.

**Current Status**: Production-ready with 30/30 AI features implemented, plus comprehensive UI localization with one outstanding issue - language preference persistence across user sessions.

## Problems It Solves
1. **International Communication Barriers**: AI-powered translation breaks down language barriers
2. **Cultural Misunderstandings**: Cultural context analysis helps users navigate cross-cultural communication  
3. **Language Interface Barriers**: Full UI localization in 20+ languages for international users
4. **Real-time Communication**: Reliable instant messaging with optimistic UI and offline support
5. **Cross-platform Access**: Works on iOS and Android through a single React Native codebase
6. **Offline Reliability**: Messages queue and sync when connectivity is restored
7. **Group Conversations**: Support for multi-person conversations with presence indicators
8. **Language Preferences**: User language settings with profile persistence (current issue: not persisting across logout/login)

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Onboarding**: User signs up with email/password or logs in
2. **Chat List**: User sees list of active conversations
3. **Messaging**: User can send/receive messages in real-time
4. **Group Chat**: User can participate in conversations with 3+ people
5. **Offline Mode**: App works offline, syncs when reconnected

### Key Behaviors
- Messages appear instantly (< 300ms when online)
- No message loss or duplication
- Sent messages show immediately (optimistic UI)
- Clear visual distinction between sent and received messages
- Scroll to latest message behavior
- Timestamps on messages
