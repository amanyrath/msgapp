# MessageAI â€” Product Context

## Why This Exists
MessageAI is being built as an MVP for a real-time messaging platform. The current focus is on creating a solid foundation for messaging functionality before adding advanced features like AI-powered message summarization or translation.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Real-time Communication**: Users need a reliable way to communicate instantly
2. **Cross-platform Access**: Works on iOS (and eventually Android) through a single codebase
3. **Offline Reliability**: Messages should queue and sync when connectivity is restored
4. **Group Conversations**: Support for multi-person conversations, not just 1-on-1 chats

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Onboarding**: User signs up with email/password or logs in
2. **Chat List**: User sees list of active conversations
3. **Messaging**: User can send/receive messages in real-time
4. **Group Chat**: User can participate in conversations with 3+ people
5. **Offline Mode**: App works offline, syncs when reconnected

### Key Behaviors
- Messages appear instantly (< 300ms when online)
- No message loss or duplication
- Sent messages show immediately (optimistic UI)
- Clear visual distinction between sent and received messages
- Scroll to latest message behavior
- Timestamps on messages

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simple & Intuitive**: Minimal learning curve, familiar chat patterns
2. **Fast & Responsive**: Instant feedback on user actions
3. **Reliable**: Messages always get delivered, even after offline periods
4. **Clean Design**: Focus on content, not chrome
5. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when things go wrong

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- AI-powered message summarization
- Real-time translation
- Push notifications
- Rich media support (images, files)
