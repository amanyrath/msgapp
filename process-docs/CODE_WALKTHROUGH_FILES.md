## üí° Pro Tips for Demo

### **What to Emphasize:**
- **Real-time subscriptions** - Show the `useEffect` cleanup patterns
- **Optimistic UI** - Point out instant message appearance
- **Error handling** - Highlight try/catch blocks and retry logic
- **Performance** - Mention sub-2s AI responses and caching
- **Cultural awareness** - Show AI providing context, not just translation

### **Code Sections to Avoid:**
- Long import statements (just mention "modular Firebase imports")
- Styling objects (focus on functionality)  
- Repetitive helper functions (mention patterns instead)
- Configuration files (firebase.js) unless specifically asked

### **Interactive Elements:**
- **Show Firebase console** - Live data updates
- **Demonstrate multi-user** - Two simulators if possible
- **AI responses** - Live translation or cultural analysis
- **Offline mode** - Toggle network to show sync

---

## üì± Simulator Demo Setup

### **Before Code Walkthrough:**
1. Have iOS simulator running with app loaded
2. Two user accounts signed in (different simulators if possible)
3. Existing conversation with messages to demonstrate AI features
4. Profile screen showing language preferences

### **During Code Walkthrough:**
1. **Show code first** - Explain the implementation
2. **Switch to simulator** - Demonstrate feature working
3. **Back to code** - Point out key technical decisions
4. **Repeat pattern** - Code ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Code

This creates a powerful narrative showing both the technical implementation and the user experience it creates.
