# 🎯 Original Message Focus Fix

## Problem Identified

The AI translation system was providing cultural context about the **translated** message instead of the **original** message, which doesn't make sense for users trying to understand what they received.

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```
Original: "¡Hola amigo! ¿Qué tal?"
Translation: "Hello friend! How's it going?"

Cultural Context: ❌
• "Hello" is a casual English greeting
• "Friend" shows informal relationship in English  
```

### **After (Correct):**
```
Original: "¡Hola amigo! ¿Qué tal?"  
Translation: "Hello friend! How's it going?"

Cultural Context: ✅
• "¡Hola!" is an enthusiastic Spanish greeting
• "Amigo" indicates warm, friendly relationship in Hispanic culture
• "¿Qué tal?" is informal - shows the sender considers you a close contact
```

## 🔧 **AI Prompt Updates**

### **Enhanced System Prompt:**
```javascript
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - CULTURAL ANALYSIS FOCUS:
- ALL cultural notes must explain the cultural significance of the ORIGINAL MESSAGE
- Help the user understand what cultural elements are present in what they RECEIVED
- Explain the sender's cultural communication style, not the translation
- Focus on the original language's cultural nuances, idioms, formality markers, and regional expressions

CULTURAL FORMALITY GUIDELINES:
- Analyze the formality level of the ORIGINAL text in its cultural context
- Explain how the original sender's tone/formality would be perceived in their culture
- Consider hierarchical vs. egalitarian aspects of the original language's culture
- Account for direct vs. indirect communication styles of the source culture
- Explain regional variations in the ORIGINAL language/culture
```

### **Clarified User Prompt:**
```javascript
ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO ANALYZE AND TRANSLATE: "¡Hola amigo!"

Please:
1. Translate the original message to English
2. Analyze the ORIGINAL message for cultural elements, formality, and regional expressions  
3. Explain what cultural aspects the user should understand about what they received
```

### **Updated Response Format:**
```json
{
  "culturalNotes": ["explanations of cultural elements in the ORIGINAL message"],
  "formalityAdjustment": "explanation of the ORIGINAL message's formality level",
  "regionalConsiderations": "regional/cultural context of the ORIGINAL message's expressions",
  "communicationStyle": "analysis of the ORIGINAL sender's communication style"
}
```

```
Original: "Buenos días, Doctor. ¿Podría ayudarme?"
Translation: "Good morning, Doctor. Could you help me?"

Cultural Context: ✅
• "Doctor" title shows high respect in Latin culture
• "Podría" (conditional) is very polite - formal register

```

• Cannot be directly translated - cultural concept unique to Japan
```

### **German Example:**
```
Original: "Könnten Sie mir bitte helfen?"  
Translation: "Could you please help me?"

Cultural Context: ✅
• "Sie" form shows formal respect for hierarchy/unfamiliarity
