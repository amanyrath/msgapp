## 🏗️ Architecture Overview (45 seconds)

### Tech Stack
```
React Native (Expo) → Firebase Services → OpenAI API
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓
• Cross-platform UI  • Real-time sync    • AI Intelligence
• Hot reload         • Authentication    • Translation
• Native performance • Offline support   • Cultural context
```

### Core Architecture
**"This follows a client-first architecture with five key layers:"**

1. **UI Layer**: React Native components with context providers
2. **State Management**: React Context (Auth, Network, Localization, Presence)
3. **Backend Services**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, RTDB for presence)
4. **AI Services**: OpenAI integration with RAG pipeline
5. **Real-time Sync**: Firestore subscriptions + offline persistence
