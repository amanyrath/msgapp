# 🎯 Original Message Analysis Fix Implementation

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: AI agent was analyzing the TRANSLATED message instead of the ORIGINAL message in regional notes and cultural context, leading to incorrect cultural analysis.

**Example Problem:**
- Original: "¡Órale!" (Mexican slang)  
- Translation: "Wow!"
- ❌ **Wrong**: AI analyzes "Wow!" and discusses English exclamations
- ✅ **Correct**: AI analyzes "¡Órale!" and explains Mexican cultural context

---

## 🔧 **Solution Implementation**

### **Enhanced AI Prompt Instructions**

#### **1. Stronger Emphasis on Source Analysis**
```javascript
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - ANALYZE THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE ONLY:
- ALL cultural analysis must focus on the ORIGINAL MESSAGE that was sent/received
- Explain what the ORIGINAL words/phrases mean in the sender's culture  
- Do NOT analyze or discuss the translation - only analyze the source text
- Focus on the original language's cultural nuances from the SOURCE culture
```

#### **2. Concrete Examples Added**
```javascript
EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ANALYSIS:
- If original is "¡Órale!": Explain this Mexican slang shows excitement/surprise in Mexican culture
- If original is "あけましておめでとう": Explain the formality level and respect shown in Japanese culture  
- If original is "Cheers mate!": Explain British informal friendliness and pub culture context
DO NOT explain what the English translation means - explain the cultural meaning of the SOURCE text!
```

#### **3. Reinforced User Prompt**
```javascript
Please:
1. Translate the original message to ${targetLanguage}
2. Analyze the ORIGINAL message "${text}" for cultural elements from ITS source culture
3. Focus cultural notes on the SOURCE culture's communication patterns, NOT the translation

Remember: Analyze "${text}" as it exists in its original cultural context, not your translation of it!
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Changes**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Original: "¡Órale, qué padre!"  
Translation: "Wow, how cool!"

❌ Cultural Notes:
- "Wow" is a common English exclamation showing surprise
- "Cool" indicates modern casual approval in English
```

### **After Fix:**  
```
Original: "¡Órale, qué padre!"
Translation: "Wow, how cool!"

✅ Cultural Notes:
- "¡Órale!" is distinctly Mexican slang expressing excitement/surprise
- "Qué padre" is Mexican colloquial meaning "how cool/awesome"  
- This combination shows informal, enthusiastic Mexican communication style
```
