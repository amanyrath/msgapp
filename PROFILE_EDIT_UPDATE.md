## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Profile Load**:
   - Fetch user document from Firestore
   - Extract nickname and icon
   - Populate form fields
   - Show defaults if missing

2. **Profile Save**:
   - Validate inputs
   - Update Firestore `/users/{userId}`
   - Update RTDB `/status/{userId}` (presence)
   - Show success message
   - Navigate back

3. **Real-time Propagation**:
   - Firestore update triggers `subscribeToUsers()` listeners
   - Chat list re-renders with new data
   - New chat screen updates user list
   - Future messages include new nickname
   - Presence shows new icon immediately

### Presence System Integration
The profile update immediately calls `setUserOnline()` to ensure:
- Icon is updated in presence indicators
- Nickname is current in all online displays
- No need to log out/in for changes to take effect

### Validation Rules
- **Nickname**: 
  - Required
  - 1-20 characters
  - Trimmed of whitespace
- **Icon**: 
  - Required
  - Max 2 characters (emoji support)
  - Trimmed of whitespace

### Error Handling
- Firestore read errors: Alert shown, returns to chat list
- Firestore write errors: Alert shown, stays on screen
- Presence update errors: Logged but non-blocking
- Network errors: Handled by retry logic in firestore utils

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Users
- Users without nickname/icon see defaults:
  - Nickname: email prefix (e.g., "john" from "john@example.com")
  - Icon: 👤 (default person icon)
- Can update profile at any time
- No migration required

### Existing Messages
- Messages with old/no nicknames still display correctly
- New messages after profile update use new nickname
- Historical accuracy maintained per message
