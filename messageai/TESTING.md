## Console Output Examples

### Successful Flow
```
Firebase connected successfully!
User signed out
Sign up successful: test@example.com
User signed in: test@example.com
Sign out successful
User signed out
Sign in successful: test@example.com
User signed in: test@example.com
```

### Error Flow
```
Sign up error: Firebase: Error (auth/email-already-in-use).
Sign in error: Firebase: Error (auth/wrong-password).
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Screen transitions**: < 100ms
- **Authentication**: < 2 seconds (network dependent)
- **Loading indicator**: Should be visible for any operation > 200ms
- **Session check**: < 500ms on app startup

## Known Limitations (MVP)

1. No password reset functionality
2. No email verification
3. No profile management
4. No "remember me" toggle (always remembers)
5. Basic error messages (not user-friendly translations)
6. No loading indicators for navigation

## Next Steps After PR #2

Once all tests pass:
1. Commit changes
2. Proceed to PR #3: Firestore Schema
3. Keep test account credentials for future testing

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
```bash
npx expo start -c  # Clear cache
```

### Navigation errors
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Firebase errors
1. Check Firebase console for Auth status
2. Verify config in `config/firebase.js`
3. Check console logs for specific error codes
