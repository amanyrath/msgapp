# Quick Fix for OpenAI API Key Issue

## The Problem
Expo isn't reading the `.env` file properly. The environment variable `$OPENAI_API_KEY` is being sent as a literal string instead of the actual API key value.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Direct API Key (Temporary - for testing)
Replace the API key detection in `utils/aiService.js` with a direct string:

```javascript
const getOpenAIClient = () => {
  if (!openai) {
    // TEMPORARY - Replace with your actual API key for testing
    const apiKey = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
    
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error('OpenAI API key not found');
    }
    
    openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey });
  }
  return openai;
};
```

### Option 2: Create .env file properly
1. Make sure you have a `.env` file in `/messageai/` directory
2. Add your key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here`
3. Restart Expo completely: `npx expo start --clear`

### Option 3: Use app.config.js (Preferred)
We've created an `app.config.js` file that should read from `.env` properly.

## Quick Test
1. Can you create the `.env` file manually with: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`?
2. Or would you like me to set up a temporary direct API key approach?

## Current Status
✅ All AI features implemented and ready
❌ Just need to fix the API key configuration
⏰ Should take 5-10 minutes to resolve

Which approach would you prefer?
